1. So I need to simplify the following equation:
  F = A'B'C' + A'B'C + A'BC + AB'C + ABC'
      Grouping:
        Group 1: A'B'(C'+C) = A'B'(1) = A'B'
        Group 2: A'BC+ABC'
        Group 3: AB'C
      Thus: F = A'B' + A'BC + AB'C + ABC'
      
      A'BC+ABC' = B(CA'+AC') = B(A'C+AC') = B(A xor C)
      Thus:
        F = A'B' + AB'C + B(A xor C)
        or
        F = A'B' + AB'C + A'BC + ABC' (since... Idk if we use xor?)

2. So I'm given the following:
  m = motion sensed
  t = test mode
  i = illuminate lamp
  I need to:
    > Illuminate lamp if motion and not test mode,
    > or if test mode and no motion,
    > or if test mode and motion.

    i = mt' + tm' + tm
    tm' + tm = t(m'+m) = t(1) = t
    i = mt' + t <--- This...

Challenges: The whole things was kind of hard. I get boolean, but grouping terms efficiently and remembering certain
ideas was rough, given that I was trying to do it all in a short timeframe. I need to brush up on this and be better
prepared.
